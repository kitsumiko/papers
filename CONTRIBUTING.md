## 📚 Paper Selection Criteria

We prioritize papers that meet these criteria:

### Must Have
- [ ] **Influential or foundational** - Highly cited, introduced key concepts, or represents a significant advance
- [ ] **Accessible** - Available via arXiv, conference proceedings, or author's website (open access preferred)
- [ ] **Relevant** - Fits within the AI/ML research landscape

### Strong Preference
- [ ] **Pedagogically valuable** - Clear writing that teaches concepts effectively
- [ ] **Well-scoped** - Focused contribution that's digestible
- [ ] **Reproducible** - Methods described in enough detail to replicate

### Phase Fit
Consider which learning phase the paper belongs to:

| Phase | Focus Area | Example Papers |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | Foundations | LeNet, AlexNet, Word2Vec |
| 2 | LLMs | BERT, GPT-3, Transformers |
| 3 | Attention | FlashAttention, RetNet |
| 4 | Retrieval | RAG, Dense Passage Retrieval |
| 5 | Reasoning & Agents | ReAct, RLHF, Constitutional AI |
| 6 | Architectures | Mamba, KAN, Neural Turing Machines |
| 7 | Interpretability | LIME, Integrated Gradients |
| 8 | Security | Prompt injection, Adversarial ML |
| 9 | Advanced | AI Scientist, Multimodal |
| 10 | Probabilistic | Diffusion, Bayesian methods |
| 11 | Vision | ViT, CLIP, SAM |
| 12 | Hardware | Photonics, VLSI |
| 13 | Policy | GDPR, EU AI Act, NIST RMF |

## 📝 How to Suggest a Paper

### Option 1: GitHub Issue (Preferred)

1. Go to [Issues → New Issue](../../issues/new/choose)
2. Select "📄 Paper Suggestion" template
3. Fill in:
   - Paper title and link (arXiv preferred)
   - Authors and publication year
   - Suggested learning phase
   - Why this paper should be included
   - A "Why read this?" annotation (1-2 sentences)

### Option 2: Pull Request

If you're comfortable with Git:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b add-paper-<short-name>`
3. Add the paper to the appropriate phase file
4. Add to `by-date.md` in the correct chronological position
5. Submit a pull request using the template

### Paper Entry Format

```markdown
### Paper Title

📄 [Paper Title](https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXXX)

**Why:** One or two sentences explaining why this paper is important and what the reader will learn.

**Key contributions:**
- Contribution 1
- Contribution 2
- Contribution 3
```

## 🔧 How to Fix Issues

### Broken Links

1. Identify the broken link
2. Find the correct URL:
   - Check [arXiv](https://arxiv.org)
   - Search [Semantic Scholar](https://semanticscholar.org)
   - Look for author's website or institutional repository
3. Open an issue or submit a PR with the fix

### Typos and Corrections

For small fixes:
1. Edit the file directly on GitHub
2. Submit as a PR with a clear description

For larger changes:
1. Open an issue first to discuss
2. Reference the issue in your PR

## 🎨 Style Guidelines

### Markdown Formatting

- Use `###` for paper titles within phase files
- Use emoji indicators:
  - 📄 for research papers
  - 🔒 for paywalled content
  - 📜 for policy documents
  - ⚠️ for important notes

### Link Formatting

```markdown
# Preferred: arXiv abstract page
[Paper Title](https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXXX)

# Acceptable: Direct PDF
[Paper Title](https://arxiv.org/pdf/XXXX.XXXXX.pdf)

# Also acceptable: Conference proceedings
[Paper Title](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/YYYY/...)
```

### Annotations

Keep "Why" annotations:
- **Concise**: 1-2 sentences maximum
- **Specific**: What will the reader learn?
- **Contextual**: How does this relate to other papers?

Good example:
> **Why:** Introduces the Transformer architecture that became the foundation for modern LLMs. Essential reading for understanding attention mechanisms.

Avoid:
> **Why:** An important paper about neural networks. (Too vague)
