# Phase 12: Hardware & Systems

[‚Üê Back to Learning Path](../learning-path.md) | [‚Üê Previous: Phase 11](phase-11-vision.md) | [üìñ Glossary](glossary.md)

**Phase Overview**: AI doesn't run on theory alone‚Äîhardware and systems design fundamentally shape what's possible. This phase examines how memory bandwidth bottlenecks limit model performance, how specialized hardware accelerators exploit AI workload characteristics, and how [distributed training](glossary.md#distributed-training) systems coordinate thousands of [GPUs](glossary.md#gpu-graphics-processing-unit) to train massive models. Understanding the hardware-software co-design is crucial for making informed decisions about model architecture, for optimizing deployment costs, and for anticipating future directions as specialized AI chips become more prevalent.

## 12.1 Hardware Considerations
**Goal**: Understand hardware-algorithm co-design
