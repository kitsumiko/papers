# Phase 3: Attention Mechanism Innovations

[← Back to Learning Path](../learning-path.md) | [← Previous: Phase 2](phase-02-llms.md)

**Phase Overview**: While transformers are powerful, their quadratic memory and compute complexity with sequence length creates significant bottlenecks. This phase explores ingenious solutions to make attention more efficient—from FlashAttention's IO-aware algorithms that dramatically speed up training, to architectural innovations like linear attention and state-space models that achieve sub-quadratic scaling. These advances are critical for processing long documents, reducing costs, and enabling real-time applications, representing some of the most active areas of current research.
