# Phase 1: Foundations (Start Here)

[‚Üê Back to Learning Path](../learning-path.md)

**Phase Overview**: This phase establishes the essential groundwork for understanding modern AI systems. You'll explore the fundamental principles of deep learning, from basic neural network architectures to the revolutionary transformer model that underpins nearly all current LLMs. By mastering these foundational concepts‚Äîincluding training dynamics, attention mechanisms, and the shift from convolutional to attention-based architectures‚Äîyou'll build the technical vocabulary and intuition needed for everything that follows. Think of this as learning the alphabet before reading literature.
