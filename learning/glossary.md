## Core Concepts

### Activation Function
A mathematical function applied to a neuron's output that introduces non-linearity into neural networks. Common examples include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh. Without activation functions, neural networks would just be linear transformations.

### Backpropagation
The fundamental algorithm for training neural networks by computing gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight. Uses the chain rule to efficiently propagate errors backward through the network.

### Batch Normalization
A technique that normalizes layer inputs by re-centering and re-scaling, making training faster and more stable. Introduced in Phase 1, it enables training much deeper networks by reducing internal covariate shift.

### Deep Learning
A subset of machine learning using neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep"). Excels at automatically learning hierarchical representations from raw data without manual feature engineering.

### Distributional Hypothesis
The linguistic principle that "words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings." Foundation of word embedding methods like Word2Vec and GloVe.

### Embeddings
Dense, continuous vector representations of discrete objects (words, tokens, images). Convert discrete symbols into points in high-dimensional space where semantic similarity corresponds to geometric proximity.

### Feature Map
The output of a convolutional layer, representing detected features at different spatial locations. Early layers detect edges; deeper layers detect complex patterns.

### Gradient Descent
The optimization algorithm that iteratively adjusts model parameters in the direction that reduces the loss function. Variants include SGD, Adam, and AdamW.

### Hidden Layer
Any layer in a neural network between the input and output layers. Where the network learns intermediate representations and transformations.

### Hyperparameter
A parameter set before training begins (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of layers). Distinct from model parameters learned during training.

### Inference
The process of using a trained model to make predictions on new data. Contrasts with training.

### Loss Function
A mathematical function that measures how far the model's predictions are from the true values. Training aims to minimize this function. Also called objective function or cost function.

### Overfitting
When a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, leading to poor generalization on new data. Addressed through regularization, dropout, or more training data.

### Regularization
Techniques to prevent overfitting by constraining model complexity. Examples: L1/L2 weight penalties, dropout, early stopping.

### Underfitting
When a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, performing poorly on both training and test sets.
