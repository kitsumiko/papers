# Learning Path: AI/ML Research Curriculum

A structured curriculum organizing papers from this collection, designed to build knowledge progressively from foundational concepts to cutting-edge research.

---

## ðŸ“š How to Use This Learning Path

This curriculum is organized into **13 progressive phases**, each building on previous knowledge. You can:

- **Follow sequentially** for a comprehensive understanding
- **Jump to specific phases** based on your interests or needs
- **Use multiple reading strategies** (see below) tailored to your role

Each phase is in a separate file for easier navigation and tracking your progress.

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Reading Strategies

### For Beginners
Start with **[Phase 1](learning/phase-01-foundations.md)** and **[Phase 2.1](learning/phase-02-llms.md#21-llm-foundations)**, then explore based on interests.

### For ML Practitioners
Start with **[Phase 2](learning/phase-02-llms.md)** (LLMs), then **[Phase 3](learning/phase-03-attention.md)** (Attention), **[Phase 5](learning/phase-05-reasoning.md)** (Agents), and **[Phase 7](learning/phase-07-interpretability.md)** (Evaluation).

### For Researchers
Follow sequentially but focus deeply on **[Phase 6](learning/phase-06-architectures.md)** (Theory), **[Phase 9](learning/phase-09-advanced.md)** (Frontiers), and your area of interest.

### For Engineers/Practitioners
Prioritize **[Phase 2](learning/phase-02-llms.md)** (Training), **[Phase 3](learning/phase-03-attention.md)** (Efficiency), **[Phase 7](learning/phase-07-interpretability.md)** (Evaluation), and **[Phase 8](learning/phase-08-security.md)** (Security).

### For Security Specialists
Follow **[Phase 1-2](learning/phase-01-foundations.md)** for foundations, then deep dive into **[Phase 8](learning/phase-08-security.md)**.

## ðŸ“– Notes on Learning

- **Don't read linearly**: Papers build on each other, so refer back to earlier papers as needed
- **Implement as you learn**: Try to implement key concepts from papers
- **Join study groups**: Discuss papers with others
- **Take notes**: Summarize key insights and connections between papers
- **Focus on intuition first**: Understand the "why" before diving into mathematical details
- **Revisit papers**: Papers reveal more insights on second or third readings
